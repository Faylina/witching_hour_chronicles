Witching Hour Chronicles

Witching Hour Chronicles is a simple blog-system for witchy articles. It is programmed primarily with PHP and consists, for now, of two pages.

The homepage (index.php) contains all the blog articles, that can be filtered by category.

The authors that are, for now, registered by the admin directly into a database, are able to log into their dashboard on the homepage and log out on both pages. 

Inside their dashboard (dashboard.php) the authors can then create new categories and write blog posts to display on the homepage.

The blog posts may or may not contain an image. If an image is included, the author can determine which side of the blog post it is displayed on. 

The blog posts are saved in a mySQL database. 

This project is meant to be heavily focused on security.
