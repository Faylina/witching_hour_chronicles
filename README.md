Witching Hour Chronicles

Witching Hour Chronicles is a simple blog-system for witchy articles. It is programmed primarily with PHP and consists, for now, of two pages.

The homepage (index.php) contains all the blog articles, that can be filtered by category.

The authors that are, for now, registered by the admin directly into a database, are able to log into their dashboard on the homepage and log out on both pages. 

Inside their dashboard (dashboard.php) the authors can then create new categories and enter blog articles to display on the homepage.

The blog article may or may not contain an image. If an image is included, the author can determine which side of the article it is displayed on. 

The blog articles are saved in a mySQL database. 

The option to edit or delete blog articles is, for now, not intended to be included in this project.

This project is meant to be heavily focused on security.
